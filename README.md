##👋 Welcome!
This repository is my **Python for Data Analysis** portfolio — where raw data meets Pandas, NumPy, and visualisation magic.  
Here, I use Python to clean, explore, and visualise datasets for insights you can act on.

## 📂 What’s Inside
- 🐼 **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)** – with step-by-step analysis  
- 📊 **Datasets** – CSV/Excel files used in the projects  
- 📸 **Visualization screenshots** – sample charts from the analysis  
- 📝 **Project notes** – objectives, approach, and conclusions

## 🔍 Skills Showcased
- Data cleaning & wrangling with **Pandas**  
- Numerical computation with **NumPy**  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Handling missing data & outliers  
- Automating repetitive analysis tasks with scripts

## 📊 Example Projects
- **Sales Data Analysis** – Seasonal trends, revenue insights, and product performance  
- **HR Analytics** – Employee attrition and hiring trend analysis  
- **ICT Inventory Insights** – Cleaning and exploring ICT equipment data  
- **Maritime Activity Analysis** – Using open-source datasets to monitor shipping trends

## 💡 My Approach
I write Python code like I’m telling a story — from **data import to final visualisation**, every step is clear and reproducible.  
The aim: transform messy datasets into clean insights without overcomplication.

## 🚀 How to Explore
1. Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.  
2. Run cells step-by-step to follow the workflow.  
3. Modify datasets or parameters to see how results change.

## 🖤 Final Note
Whether you’re just starting with Python or deep into data science,  
feel free to fork, run, and adapt these projects for your learning.  
Data speaks — Python helps it sing.
